# OnlineStatusChanger

This plugin was developed to handle a GUI method of changing a user's in-game status.
Due to how textboxes need to work in BakkesMod, the game would crash any time an edit was made.
This adds a temporary cvar textbox, then applies the temp string to the final cvar when the user clicks Apply.
